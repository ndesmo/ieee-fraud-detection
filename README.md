# ieee-fraud-detection
Detect fraudulent online transactions

In this project I am attempting to correctly classify fraudulent online e-commerce transactions, using the [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/data) dataset.

In order to run the code, you must first download the input files from Kaggle. You can then refer to these from the command line when running either `process_data.py`, `train_classifier.py` or `run_model.py`

## Libraries required

It is recommended to use Anaconda, so that the following libraries will be simple to install or already installed:

* pandas
* numpy
* sklearn
* sqlalchemy

Also, the code refers to itself. Please add the ieee_fraud_detection directory to your PYTHONPATH.
